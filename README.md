# **LeetDirect**
Hi, everyone! 

LeetDirect is a chrome extension to block popular social media sites and redirect users to leetcode!

Recently, my brother has been way too addicted to playing chess and doesn't react to the memes I sent him. To combat this, I have decided to create a chrome extension to block chess direct him to leetcode practice. All webrequests to chess.com or twitch.tv will be redirected to leetcode hard, other sites will be random between medium and easy questions. I have also changed all difficulty labels to say easy so that my brother will believe all the questions are easy and be more encouraged to do the problems. Hehehe...

I hope this troll chrome extension is useful in your journey to fight back your productivity as well :)


# **Setup**
1. Visit chrome://extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**
