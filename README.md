# **LeetDirect**
Hi, everyone! 

LeetDirect is a chrome extension to block popular social media sites and redirect users to leetcode!

Recently, my brother has been way too addicted to playing chess and doesn't react to the memes I sent him. In order to get my brother's attention back, I 
have decided to create a chrome extension to block chess for him and direct him to leetcode practice. There is also another surprise in here, but I cannot 
tell you yet ;)



# **Setup**
1. Visit chrome://extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory
